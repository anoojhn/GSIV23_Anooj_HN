This app has been built on The Remix Indie Stack using create-remix@latest.

(a) To run the application:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    To test the application: 

    ```sh
    npx cypress open
    ```
    and run tests on chrome or electron.

(b) In this challenge, I gave Remix a try for the first time. I think I did well with it. Particularly in designing and developing the movie card and movie details pages.  I took the initiative to utilize tailwindcss which came in-built with Remix indies stack.  I took the opportunity to experiment and integrate it within the project. These examples highlight my skills, demonstrating how well I can learn and use new technologies to create components that work well and look good.

(c) If  I had a few more hours, I would have invested that time in convertings this application into a PWA. I had already dedicated some time to researching the process online. Additionally, I would have implemented skeleton loaders to enhance the infinite scrolling feature's appearance of smoothness and seamlessness. 


PS: I have implemented Frontend Search for searching movies in list page. The APIs exposed by TMDB do not support filtering (upcoming movies) and searching at the same time. Due to this, pagination will not work for search results.
